KPROBE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kprobe is a very simple method to probe the running kernel. 
At a fundamental level, it requires the address of a kernel function that needs to be debugged. 
Then, you create pre- and post-handlers that will print a debugging message when the target kernel function is called. 
(Actually, a handler performs any action specified in its code; in this case, it happens to be printing.) 
Thus, every time that function is called, you can track it.

SystemTap Setup on Ubuntu-12.04 LTS

SystemTap Introduction:

SystemTap can monitor multiple system-wide synchronous and asynchronous events at the same time. 
It can do scriptable filtering and statistics collection. 
Itâ€™s a dynamic method of monitoring and tracing the operations of a running Linux kernel.

To instrument the running kernel, SystemTap uses Kprobes and return probes. With kernel debug information, 
it gets the addresses for functions and variables referenced in the script. 
With utrace, SystemTap supports probing user-space executables and shared libraries as well. 
SystemTap is, therefore, useful to systems administrators, kernel developers, support engineers, researchers and students.


Installation Infomation:

sudo apt-get install -y systemtap

Where to get debug symbols for kernel X? - check "uname -r" for kernel version
